    "# BotSim-24 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard facts:**\n",
    "* Release year: 2024\n",
    "* Domain: Synthetic simulation of social media behavior (Twitter/X–like platform)\n",
    "* Size: configurable (typically 10k–100k user agents)\n",
    "* Labels: bot vs human (ground truth, generated by simulator)\n",
    "* Features: behavioral and temporal metrics (posting frequency, burstiness, coordination, interaction ratios)\n",
    "* Data type: fully synthetic with controlled parameters for activity rate, coordination level, and posting regularity\n",
    "* Simulation scenarios: include isolated bots, coordinated botnets, and mixed human–bot communities\n",
    "* Use case: robustness testing for bot detection models trained on real-world data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "The BotSim-24 dataset is a large-scale synthetic simulation of social media user behavior. It was created to evaluate bot detection systems under controlled yet realistic conditions, providing clean ground-truth labels. Each simulated agent exhibits time-stamped posting behavior, interaction patterns, and coordination features modeled after real-world distributions of activity and engagement.\n",
    "Unlike real datasets such as BotArtist or Fox8-23, BotSim-24’s labels are perfectly known, making it ideal for behavioral model training, stress testing, and fusion calibration in multimodal detection systems.\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "### Temporal Activity\n",
    "* mean_inter_event_time – Average time (in seconds/minutes) between two consecutive posts.\n",
    "* std_inter_event_time – Standard deviation of inter-event times (activity irregularity).\n",
    "* burstiness – Normalized measure of posting bursts, calculated as (σ−μ)/(σ+μ).\n",
    "* circadian_entropy – Entropy of activity across 24 hours; lower values indicate more regular posting.\n",
    "* active_hours_ratio – Fraction of time spent posting during daytime hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interaction Behavior\n",
    "* reply_ratio – Proportion of posts that are replies.\n",
    "* retweet_ratio – Proportion of posts that are retweets.\n",
    "* mention_ratio – Fraction of posts that mention other users.\n",
    "* url_share_ratio – Fraction of posts containing URLs.\n",
    "* hashtag_use_rate – Average number of hashtags per post.\n",
    "* Coordination & Overlap\n",
    "* shared_url_overlap – Jaccard overlap of URLs shared by this user with others (coordination signal).\n",
    "* shared_hashtag_overlap – Fraction of hashtags shared with a user’s cluster peers.\n",
    "* synchrony_index – Proportion of posts occurring simultaneously (within a short time window) with other bots.\n",
    "* cosine_sim_to_cluster_centroid – Similarity of posting pattern to the cluster mean (behavioral mimicry).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cascade & Diffusion\n",
    "* cascade_depth_mean – Average depth of reply/retweet cascades initiated by this account.\n",
    "* cascade_width_mean – Average number of direct replies/retweets per cascade.\n",
    "* max_cascade_size – Maximum number of participants in a cascade initiated by this user.\n",
    "* reproduction_number – Approximate branching factor, estimating how fast a cascade spreads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Account Metadata (optional)\n",
    "* account_age_days – Account lifetime in days.\n",
    "* followers_count – Number of followers (simulated).\n",
    "* friends_count – Number of followed accounts.\n",
    "* statuses_count – Total number of posts.\n",
    "* activity_rate – Posts per day, calculated as statuses_count / account_age_days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label:\n",
    "* bot_label — binary class label (1 = bot, 0 = human)."
